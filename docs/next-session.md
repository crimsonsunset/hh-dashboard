# Next Session Planning

*This is a working document for active session planning and immediate priorities. Update this document throughout development sessions to track progress and plan next steps.*

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025

## Current Session Status
✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Core data explorer fully implemented

## Recent Accomplishments (October 21, 2025)
- ✅ Fixed mock data loading for production (moved to `/public/data/`)
- ✅ Implemented file upload with drag-and-drop (react-dropzone)
- ✅ Created three-layer validation system (extension, JSON, schema)
- ✅ Fixed error message display with Ant Design App component
- ✅ Moved error messages to bottom of screen for better UX
- ✅ Updated service layer to use configured `apiClient`
- ✅ All core features working: data loading, charts, tables, file upload
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect current state

## Immediate Priorities for Next Session
- [ ] Wire header controls (date picker & metrics selector) to URL params
- [ ] Implement URL-based filtering (filtering-arch.md Option A)
- [ ] Add error boundaries at route level
- [ ] Test shareable URLs with filters

## Phase 2 Considerations
- [ ] Chart type selector dropdown
- [ ] Additional chart types (token usage, cost analysis, quality scores)
- [ ] Metrics cards at top of dashboard
- [ ] Enhanced data exploration features

## Technical Debt to Address
- No error boundaries implemented
- No loading skeletons (using spinners instead)
- Header controls are placeholders (not wired to state)
- No tests (acceptable for MVP)

## Notes & Decisions
- Phase 1 is feature-complete as of Oct 21, 2025
- File upload completed ahead of schedule (was Phase 3)
- Mock data properly served from `/public/data/` for production builds
- Validation working correctly with user-facing error messages
- Ready for initial git commit once header controls are wired

## Next Major Milestone
**Goal**: Wire URL-based filtering
**Timeline**: Next session
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 complete ✅
