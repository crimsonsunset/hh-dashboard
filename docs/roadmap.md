- **Zustand 5.x** - Lightweight state management (theme, UI preferences)
- **TanStack Query 5.x** - Server state management and caching

### UI & Visualization
- **Ant Design 5.x** - Comprehensive component library with theming
- **Recharts 3.x** - Composable charting library for data visualization

### Data & API
- **Axios 1.x** - HTTP client for API calls
- Mock data currently served from `/public/data/`

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Dashboard (75% Complete) ðŸ”¨
**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: October 2025

#### Completed âœ…
- [x] Project scaffolding with Vite + React + TypeScript
- [x] TanStack Router setup with file-based routing
- [x] Path aliases configuration (@stores, @components, etc.)
- [x] Zustand store for global state (theme, sidebar, loading)
- [x] Ant Design integration with theme system
- [x] Dark/light theme toggle with persistent state
- [x] Responsive dashboard layout with collapsible sidebar
- [x] Route structure (dashboard, data view, settings placeholder)
- [x] React Query setup with hooks
- [x] Axios configuration for API calls
- [x] Mock analytics data structure
- [x] Analytics service layer
- [x] ESLint configuration with TypeScript rules

#### In Progress ðŸ”¨
- [ ] Metrics cards component (revenue, users, conversions, pageViews)
- [ ] Chart components using Recharts
- [ ] Dashboard page UI implementation
- [ ] Data integration (connect React Query to UI)

#### Pending
- [ ] Date range picker integration
- [ ] Loading and error states
- [ ] Responsive chart behavior

### Phase 2: Data Visualization & Interactivity
**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete

#### Goals
- [ ] Advanced chart types (line, bar, area, pie)
- [ ] Interactive tooltips and legends
- [ ] Chart drill-down capabilities
- [ ] Metric comparison views
- [ ] Data table with sorting and filtering
- [ ] Export chart as image functionality

### Phase 3: Data Management
**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

#### Goals
- [ ] File upload component (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Data parsing and validation
- [ ] Data transformation utilities
- [ ] Export data functionality
- [ ] Multiple dataset management
- [ ] Data source switching

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete

#### Goals
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Real API integration (replace mock data)
- [ ] Real-time data updates with WebSockets
- [ ] Dashboard customization (widget arrangement)
- [ ] Saved views and bookmarks
- [ ] Notification system

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
**Status**: Not Started

#### Goals
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] SEO optimization
- [ ] Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Analytics tracking
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Patterns
- **State Management Strategy**: 
  - Zustand for private global state (theme, UI preferences)
  - TanStack Router for URL state (filters, date ranges)
  - React Query for server state (API data, caching)
  
- **File Naming Convention**: 
  - Components: `kebab-case.component.tsx`
  - Stores: `kebab-case.store.ts`
  - Services: `kebab-case.service.ts`
  - Hooks: `kebab-case.hook.ts`
  
- **Import Strategy**: 
  - Path aliases for all top-level src directories
  - Clean imports without relative path hell

### Why These Technologies?

**TanStack Router**
- Type-safe routing with full TypeScript inference
- File-based routing for intuitive structure
- Built-in code splitting
- URL state management for shareable views

**Zustand**
- Minimal boilerplate vs Redux
- No context provider needed
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Tiny bundle size (~1KB)

**Ant Design**
- Comprehensive component library
- Built-in theming system
- Enterprise-grade quality
- Active maintenance and community

**Recharts**
- React-first charting library
- Composable API
- Responsive by default
- Good TypeScript support

## Known Issues & Technical Debt
- No git commit history yet (project pending initial commit)
- Dashboard route has placeholder content only
- No error boundaries implemented
- No loading skeletons for data fetching
- Mock data uses 2024 dates (might need updating)

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding Storybook for component development
- Evaluate need for animation library (Framer Motion?)
- Plan for internationalization (i18n) if needed
- Consider adding E2E tests with Playwright
- Evaluate backend needs (Node.js, Python, Go?)
